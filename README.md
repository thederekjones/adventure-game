# Project Instructions
* [x] Print descriptions of what's happening for the player
* [x] Pausing between printing descriptions
* [x] Give the player some choices
* [x] Make sure the player gives a valid input
* [x] Add functions and refactor your code
* [x] Use randomness in your game
* [x] Create win and lose conditions
* [x] Check if the player wants to play again
* [x] Check your style with pycodestyle
* [x]  Test Your Code
* ### Standout Suggestions
  * [x] Identify the repetitive parts and refactor them into functions.
  * [x] Reduce redundancy by applying the DRY principle.
  * [x] Use intuitive function names and avoid generic names to provide clear context.
  * [x] Avoid using global variables in the functions.
